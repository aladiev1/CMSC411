sin and cos approximation using taylor series using ARM multiplication code found here: https://github.com/bnat1/arm-calculator

Also used taylor series to approximate sinh, cosh, and e^x

FDIVS was used to calculate tan and tanh. Hopefully this is okay since the requirement was to just avoid the use of the built in MUL

The 2 main constants are ANGLE and EXPONENTIAL_PARAMETER

	ANGLE is the angle used for the input of the trig functions. EXPONENTIAL_PARAMETER is the input parameter for e^x. Both values should be in IEEE 754 format
	
After running TrigApproximation.s, the following registers will be set

	r8 and s8: Sin(ANGLE)
	r9 and s9: Cos(ANGLE)
	r7 and s7: e^EXPONENTIAL_PARAMETER
	r6 and s6: Sinh(ANGLE)
	r5 and s5: Cosh(ANGLE)
	s10		 : Tan(ANGLE)
	s4		 : Tanh(ANGLE)
	
Report will be done by the time we present our project
